# Cleaned data notebook

From the repository root, install the notebook dependencies and start Jupyter:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r notebooks/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m jupyterlab notebooks/01_explore_clean_data.ipynb
```

Use the Python kernel from this environment. If using the VS Code notebook editor,
select `.venv/bin/python` as the kernel.

Configure the repository `.env` using `.env.example`. The notebook reuses
`src.database.get_connection()` to connect to `DB_SERVER` and `DB_NAME` and read
`dbo.CleanedSensorData`. The configured account needs SELECT permission on the
table. Install Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server separately from the Python
requirements.

Run the cells in order. Optional start/end timestamps restrict the query;
otherwise it loads the entire table into memory. The resulting `df` has a
sorted datetime index and one column per sensor. Connections are closed after
loading, and no database writes are performed.

Clear notebook outputs before committing to keep sensor readings out of Git.
